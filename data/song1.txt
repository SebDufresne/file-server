[Verse 1]
Three thirty in the mornin', not a soul in sight
The city's lookin' like a ghost town on a moonless summer night
Raindrops on the windshield, there's a storm movin' in
He's headin' back from somewhere that he never should have been

[Refrain]
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

[Verse 2]
Every light is burnin' in a house across town
She's pacin' by the telephone in her faded flannel gown
Askin' for a miracle, hopin' she's not right
Prayin' it's the weather that's kept him out all night

[Refrain]
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

[Chorus]
The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls

[Verse 3]
She's waitin' by the window when he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him, thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes, and he knows that she knows

[Refrain]
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls

[Chorus]
The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls

[Verse 4]
She runs back down the hallway, and through the bedroom door
She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer
Tells the lady in the mirror, "He won't do this again"
'Cause tonight will be the last time she'll wonder where he's been

[Chorus]
The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls
